<h2>Blocking until done</h2>

  <p>I have an application that validates server connection, if it works the application is happy and can safely exit. It does the check by calling suspending function <code class="java">connectToServer</code>. But the connection is slow and the app needs to wait until the function returns before it can report the success. Can you help to fix the app?</p> 
  <p>Fix the call of <code class="java">connectToServer</code> by wrapping it with proper coroutine builder.</p>
