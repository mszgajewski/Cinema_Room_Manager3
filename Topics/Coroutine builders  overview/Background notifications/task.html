  <p>Loading data from the server can be a long operation, so we want to entertain a user while the computer is busy loading the content. To do that let's launch a function that writes a message every second that the app is still alive. When the loading is done our app should finish and so should our loading and notification functions.</p> 
  <p>Start two coroutines. Start `loadData` in a blocking way so the app doesn't finish before it's done. Start `printProgress` in a fire-and-forget way to keep printing the message in the background while the app is running.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-573').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-573" style="display:none;">
   `launch` coroutine builder requires a scope as the receiver, for example `GlobalScope.launch()`
  </div>
